# 🎸 Band Name Generator App

Welcome to my very first Python project! This is part of a Python training course I'm currently taking. The goal? Create a fun little program that helps you come up with your *rockstar-worthy* band name. 🤘

## 💡 What It Does

You enter:
- The city you grew up in
- The name of a pet

And it spits out your epic band name by combining the two. Simple, but fun!

## 🧪 How to Run It (Locally)

If you want to try it out on your machine:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/band-name-generator.git
   cd band-name-generator
   ```

2. Install the requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app using Streamlit:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🌐 Live Demo

Want to skip all that and just try it in your browser?

## 🚀 What's Next?

This is just the beginning. I’ll be building more Python apps as I move through my training — stay tuned!
